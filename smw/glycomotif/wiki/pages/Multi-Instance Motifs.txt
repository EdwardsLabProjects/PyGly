Motifs in the "All Motifs" collection that appear in at least twice in primary collections, generally due to inclusion in more than one primary collection.

The All Motifs and Glydin collections, both of which non-redundantly aggregate other motif collections, are not primary collections.

These motifs have names, aglycon, and reducing end values that represent the union of the values from their primary collections' motifs, and are likely to have trivial and non-trivial name, aglycon, and reducing end value conflicts.
