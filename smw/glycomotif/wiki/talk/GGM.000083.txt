Per the abstract, Cytolipin R is "N-acetylgalactosaminyl(beta1-->3)galactosyl(alpha1-->3) galactosyl(beta1-->4)glucosyl ceramide". 

This abstract also indicates that Cytolipin K (globoside I) differs in having a -galactosyl(alpha1-->4)galactosyl- internal linkage.

Cytolipin K (globoside I) can be found as [[GGM.000070]].
