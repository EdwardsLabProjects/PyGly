== Monosaccharide Comparison ==

Aligned motif and glycan monosaccharides must:

1. have the same number of carbon atoms (HEX, PENT, etc.); and 

2. have the same stem-type (Man, Glc, etc.), if the motif monosaccharide stem-type is specified; and 

3. have the same orientation (D-type, L-type), if the motif monosaccharide orientation is specified; and

4. have the same ring information (1:5, etc.), if the motif monosaccharide ring information is specified; and 

5. have the same anomeric configuration (&alpha;, &beta;), if the motif monosaccharide anomeric configuration is specified.
