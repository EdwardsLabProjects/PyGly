== Glycosidic Bond Comparison ==

Each specific characteristic of the aligned glycosidic bonds attaching a child monosaccharide to a parent monosaccharides are considered to be sets. Missing characteristics represent a set containing all possible values. For a strict alignment, glycan glycosidic bond characteristics must be contained in (or, a subset of) the corresponding glycosidic bond monosaccharide characteristics. For a non-strict alignment, glycan glycosidic bond characteristics must have an non-empty intersection with the corresponding motif glycosidic bond characteristics. 

Since linkage type and child linkage position typically are either specified with a single value or are missing, we can simplify the above statements as follows:

For a strict alignment, aligned motif and glycan glycosidic bonds attaching a child monosaccharide to a parent monosaccharide must: 

1a. have the same child linkage type (n,d,...), if the motif glycosidic bond child linkage type is specified; and 

2a. have the same child linkage position (1,2,...), if the motif glycosidic bond child linkage position is specified; and 

3a. have the same parent linkage type (d,o,...), if the motif glycosidic bond parent linkage type is specified; and

4a. have the glycan parent linkage positions (2,3,4,5,6,...) be a subset of the motif glycosidic bond parent linkage position.
 
For a non-strict alignment, aligned motif and glycan glycosidic bonds attaching a child monosaccharide to a parent monosaccharide must: 

1b. have the same child linkage type (n,d,...), if the motif and glycan glycosidic bond child linkage type are specified; and 

2b. have the same child linkage position (1,2,...), if the motif glycosidic bond child linkage position are specified; and 

3b. have the same parent linkage type (d,o,...), if the motif glycosidic bond parent linkage type are specified; and

4b. have the glycan parent linkage positions (2,3,4,5,6,...) have non-empty intersection with the motif glycosidic bond parent linkage positions.
